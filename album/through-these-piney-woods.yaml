Lyrics: |-
    Changes march in regiments
    But you can't get the hang of it
    The birthday wishes came and went
    But you still felt the same

    Now you're graduated and I am too
    But your memories aren't through with you
    I can promise, though, when this song is through
    I will still be here

    I know that it's a shame
    How some people change
    But only the good ones

    I'll try to stand really still
    And maybe I will
    Stay just the way you like me

    The sun is rising quickly now
    In the way that only it knows how
    I'll kiss you before our time runs out
    And we both go to bed

    And though that seems the thing to do
    I'd rather stay awake with yout
    And wander off to something new
    So that's what I suggest

    We'll go to some place that's warm
    And what came before
    Can never hurt us again

    And the tears that we struggle to hide
    Will be nowhere in sight
    And we'll never change a thing

    If you have these feelings too
    I’ll do the best that I can do
    I swear to god I’m here for you
    And that won’t ever change

    I swear to god I’m here for you
    And that won’t ever change

    >This song is one of my favorites, how did you get the inspiration to write such a beautiful song?
    Thank you! I really like this one too. These three songs are a very dramatized reenactment of my first year of college when I moved really far away from my home and friends. This one specifically is about a girl I dated in high school who I really liked and planned to stay with after I moved. But I abruptly decided I'd rather gamble on meeting someone at college so I dumped her weeks before I left. Of course I never met anyone and dropped out a year later, and my decision to break up with her caused a fair bit of heartache for a few years. So I originally wrote it as a bitter and ironic way to throw the things I told her when we were in love back in my own face. But that's only what it means to me, I always try to make my songs vague enough to be interpreted differently by everybody.

Lyrics: |-
    You know, I had a good thing going
    I just wanted something different

    It may sound dumb, but my excuse is I did what I had to do to ensure I made something of my life

    I was right to get out of that city
    That's what I say to my reflection

    Growing up, it seems to me, is missing how things used to be, Yeah, someday soon I'll feel alright again
    
    Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    And I keep walking past the river
    I can't believe how it keeps rolling

    Rushing forward, always going, it never balks at the unknown and never misses what it leaves behind

    And as the summer dries the forest
    And the riverbed is cracked and empty

    It fills back up with the next rain and moves ahead like nothing changed, it’s the kind of man I always wished I was
    The kind of man I know I’ll never be

    Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
    Oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    >I feel like this song is the other side of Move, though I doubt it was intended
    Ya know I guess it is. This one is about when I moved away from my hometown for the first time so it is pretty much the inverse, I don't think I ever noticed that before

Lyrics: |-
    Well it was pretty dreary
    In that one horse town
    Two streets through the middle
    And forest all around

    Darker than a blood clot
    Deeper than a pit
    And all the folks who lived 'round there
    Never entered it

    Well I was sick and lonesome
    And I spent all my time
    Walking from one part of town
    To the other side

    Well, I'd had my fill of walking
    And living in my skin
    So I walked into the woods
    And didn't come out again

    I was saying
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    Through these piney woods

    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    Through these piney woods

    Walked into the forest
    Until I lost my way
    I didn’t worry 'bout it
    Because I had plans to stay

    I walked ahead for miles
    ’Til I was really sure
    That no one would find me
    Even if they searched

    The city just a memory
    I traveled far enough
    I saw the roots beneath me
    The branches up above

    I saw the coming twilight
    Though the canopy
    I made a bed of pine needles
    And I began to sleep

    I said
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    Through these piney woods

    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    I'm so tired of walking
    Through these piney woods

    And I figured what’s waiting if I keep going?
    I could get a job and I could buy a home
    Just a place to drive to and a lawn to mow
    So I let myself doze off

    And I became the grass, and I became the seeds
    And the big purple plums sitting in the trees
    Oh the soil and the river and autumn leaves
    You know I never really left

    And I’m no longer lonesome
    And I’m no longer ailing
    And I’m not scared of nothing anymore

    And now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    In these piney woods

    And now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    In these piney woods

    And now I live forever
    And now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    In these piney woods
    
    And now I live forever
    And now I live forever
    Now I live forever
    In these piney woods

    Well I wrote this song when I as 17 or 18 and I was going to college in Nacogdoches, Texas, which is a smallish town surrounded by miles and miles of impenetrable pine forest. To me, the song is about how isolated I felt my first year away from home. But I always, always make it a point to have my songs be open ended enough so that any listener can feel like the song describes their own life and experiences.
