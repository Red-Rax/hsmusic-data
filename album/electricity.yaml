Lyrics: |-
    Nothing ever works out
    Nothing ever will
    There's not a place for you in this world
    That hasn't already been filled

    I guess you thought that
    It would just get better with time
    But your feelings didn't change
    You just pushed them deeper inside

    [You can't be happy
    Without control, i know
    And you don't know
    How to be alone, i know]

Lyrics: |-
    Some way to tell you
    Some way to find
    Some way to reach you
    Outside my mind
Commentary: |-
    <i>Kalibration:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://kalibration.bandcamp.com/track/release))
    I could never hate you. Even in those worst days of my life, I never did.
    But my heart's no metronome. It can't swing in and out on time.
    I know now it's a lightning storm.
