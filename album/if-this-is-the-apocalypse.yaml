    <i>Scott Stutzman:</i> ([Soundcloud playlist description,](https://soundcloud.com/kasko-lunsford/sets/if-this-is-the-apocalypse), excerpt)
    A story told from three perspectives of a hypothetical Armageddon brought on by natural disaster and civil unrest. [[artist:scott-stutzman]] sings and plays every instrument on all tracks (except for the electric guitar in "[[track:flood]].")
    <i>Scott Stutzman:</i> ([Youtube comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_DsyLbqx4Q&lc=UgjEN4pVBp4FZngCoAEC.8ECO21Yqav58EUBZrdpOs7), excerpt)
    I'd always intended to record (and am currently working on) new versions of the songs from "[[album:if-this-is-the-apocalypse]]" so the past few years I've been trying to keep the originals offline to prevent confusion in the future. But I put the originals up on [Bandcamp](https://scottstutzman.bandcamp.com/album/if-this-is-the-apocalypse) a few months ago because someone on Twitter actually remembered when I released them back in 2012 and wanted to hear them again. I'll probably take the originals back down again after I start releasing the new versions. Since it's a temporary kind of deal I don't think I'll put them on YouTube, but the whole album is totally free to download so you can snag it if you like.
    <i>Red Rax<i> (wiki editor):
    The original release of this album in 2012 on [Bandcamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20121101031246/http://kaskolunsford.bandcamp.com:80/album/if-this-is-the-apocalypse) and [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kasko-lunsford/sets/if-this-is-the-apocalypse) only had the first three tracks.  The two covers were added in a 2016 re-release and come from [[album:growing-older-growing-up]].  Despite the commentary, the new recordings have never surfaced.

Lyrics: |-
    If the end is near, then I can't say I'm surprised
    I've been waiting half my life for the big one

    May be coming soon, maybe sooner than we think
    Maybe we're all on the brink of kingdom come

    As the saltwater's pouring through the seawall
    Every person behind it will drown

    If I'm only brave once in my lifetime
    It will be when the world's burning down

    And I'll leave my house and I'll step into the street
    As the water soaks my feet and houses flood

    But I will not fall though the current pulls me down
    And I cannot see the ground through swirling mud

    And the cowards flock seeking safety in their mobs
    Pray salvation from a God who wants them dead

    And I'll laugh a bit as we're taken by the sea
    Cause I'll know that finally there's light ahead

    And I'll breathe in the cool, salty sea breeze
    As I float in a skiff through my town

    If I'm only brave once in my lifetime
    It will be when the world's burning down

    And the hot winds blow, as the sun beats down on me
    it's at least a hundred three and getting dry

    And the gardens die when the days keep getting hotter
    And we all run out of water overnight

    And the people cry when the crops start turning black
    And the flowers won't grow back and fires blaze

    And the leaves all change in the middle of july
    And the sun up in the sky won't go away

    But I'll walk like a man through the wildfires
    With my feet firmly pressed to the ground

    If I'm only brave once in my lifetime
    It will be when the world's burning down

    And the cops will train their rifles at the people throwing rocks
    As the razor wire rises in between the city blocks

    And the rockets fly through neighborhoods and smoke consumes the day
    I'll keep walking like I always do, I will not look away

    I will march with conviction through the panic
    Even as people near me fall down
    
    I will live as I have without terror
    Even when there is death all around

    I will stand eye-to-eye with the end times
    and I'll take what they've got pound for pound

    If I'm only brave once in my lifetime
    It will be when the world's burning down

    Hm-mm mm mm mm mm-mm mm-mm mm-mm-mm
    Mm-mm mm mm mm mm mm mm-mm-mm

Lyrics: |-
  When the plum tree fell, that's when it began
  As the southern winds dried up the land
  It died that spring, it had to get chopped down

  Then the summer came and filled the streets
  With charcoal dust and orange leaves
  The soil blew in clouds across my yard

  So I packed up all my scarce belongings
  and I drove until I washed up here

  I feared that a new age could be dawning
  I couldn't stand to waste another year

  And so I made this long sojourn
  I told my friends I might return
  Although I knew my home was gone for good

  And as I drove I saw first-hand
  The endless smoke and cracking land
  The trees were dead, the cows were skin and bones

  That was when I knew the world was ending
  As I watched the dust black out the moon

  That's why I sought refuge in this city
  That's why I needed to talk to you

  So I'll ask you please to come along
  When the sun comes up I'll be moving on
  And we might survive if we have each other's backs

  I'm leaving soon for now I fear
  What I escaped is coming here
  I don't know how but we'll keep hanging on

  So the stories keep on getting written
  Even as the final page draws nigh

  I don't know why I want to keep living
  Something keeps telling me to survive, mmmm

Lyrics: |-
  "Let the rain pour down" I heard the old folks say
  "We haven't left these homes in thirty years", mmm-mm-mm

  "Hurricanes they come and hurricanes they go
  But still these old foundations remain here" mmm-mm-mm

  That was what they said before the breakers
  Came rolling through the alleys and the streets

  I guess I'll never go back to the city
  Now that it's thirteen feet beneath the sea

  Bring on the flood
  Oh, bring on the flood
  I prayed that God would save us, but we weren't in his plan
  So bring on the flood

  "Let the rain pour down" I heard the preacher say
  It's really in our best interest because mmm-mm-mm

  It's here to cleanse the earth of all it's sinful ways
  To wash away the wicked but not us mmm-mm-mm

  I always figured God would grant some lenience
  to our little earthbound flock of sheep

  I guess we weren't as perfect as he'd hoped for
  Cause now the church is neath the briney deep

  Bring on the flood
  Oh, bring on the flood
  I went to church each Sunday but it wasn't good enough
  Bring on the flood

  If the Rapture really happened, I guess we got left behind
  If you're looking for salvation then you better get in line

  And if there's someone up there then I'll tell you it's unjust
  That He gave Noah warning and that's more than he gave us

  Bring on the flood
  Oh, bring on the flood
  Oh, things seem less important now that destruction is near
  But I still have one more question before we all disappear
  If this is the apocalypse then how come God's not here?
  Oh, bring on the flood
  Oh, bring on the flood
