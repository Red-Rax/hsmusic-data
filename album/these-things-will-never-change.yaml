Lyrics: |-
    Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City, you're a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yeah you do
    Times Square can't shine as bright as you, I swear it's true

    Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance, I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
    Listen to my voice, it's my disguise, I'm by your side

    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me
    What you do to me

    Hey there, Delilah, I know times are getting hard, but just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
    We'll have the life we knew we would, my word is good

    Hey there, Delilah, I got so much left to say, if every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
    Even more in love with me, you'd fall, we'd have it all

    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me

    A thousand miles seems pretty far, but they've got planes, and trains, and cars, I'd walk to you if I had no other way
    Our friends would all make fun of us, and we'll just laugh along because we know that none of them have felt this way
    Delilah, I can promise you that by the time we get through the world will never, ever be the same, and you're to blame

    Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me, two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be making history like I do
    You'll know it's all because of you
    We can do whatever we want to
    Hey there, Delilah, here's to you, This one's for you

    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me
    Oh, it's what you do to me, O-oh, it's what you do to me
    What you do to me
    Oh-oh, oh-oh woah-o-o-o-on
    woah-oh, woah-o-o-o-on
    woah-oh, woah-o-o-o-on

Lyrics: |-
    We'll do it all
    Everything
    On our own

    We don't need
    Anything
    Or anyone

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

    I don't quite know
    How to say
    How I feel

    Those three words
    Are said too much
    They're not enough

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

    Forget what we're told
    Before we get too old
    Show me a garden that's bursting into life

    Let's waste time
    Chasing cars
    Around our heads

    I need your grace
    To remind me
    To find my own

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

    Forget what we're told
    Before we get too old
    Show me a garden that's bursting into life

    All that I am
    All that I ever was
    Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

    I don't know when
    Confused about how, as well
    Just know that these things will never change for us at all

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
