Lyrics: |-
    There's something that I can't quite explain
    I'm so in love with you, you never take that away
    And if I said it a hundred times before
    Expect a thousand more, you never take that away

    Well expect me to be calling you to see if you're okay when I'm not around
    Asking if you love me, oh I love the way you make it sound
    Calling you to see do I try too hard to make you smile?
    To make us smile

    I will keep calling you to see
    If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
    If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
    I can't believe you actually picked me

    I thought that the world had lost its sway
    Then I fell in love with you, and you took that away
    You take away the old and show me the new
    And I feel like I can fly when I stand next to you, so while I'm on this phone, a hundred miles from home, I'll take the words you say and I;ll give them back to you

    I only want to see, if you're okay when I'm not around
    Asking if you love me, oh I love the way you make it sound
    Calling you to see, do I try too hard to make you smile?
    To make us smile

    I will keep calling you to see
    If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
    If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
    I can't believe you actually picked me

    Calling you to see
    If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
    If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
    I can't believe you actually picked me
    I will keep calling you to see
    If you're sleeping, are you dreaming?
    If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
    I can't believe you actually picked me
    I will keep calling you
    Calling you
    Calling you to see
    Well I will keep calling you
    Calling you
    Calling you to see
    I will keep calling you
    Calling you
    Calling you to see
    I will keep calling you
    Calling you
    Calling you to see

Lyrics: |-
    It's night but I can't stay asleep
    But you do, straight through till morning
    When you pour my coffee and say, "Baby
    Oh that caffeine
    Causes bad dreams
    Where all your anxiety
    is unleashed"

    Lately my days aren't much better
    Can't concentrate when I'm at work
    I just think and think till my head hurts
    Of the payment
    Plans I'm making
    I just wanted to provide for you

    And if you wanna make a run for it, my love, I'd cover you
    And if you need money for bills, my lover, I could cover you

    Cause I sold some shit, I'm saving up
    We can get that house next to the park
    I'll work more hours at my dad's shop
    We will plan for everything

    And we'll enroll in that middle class
    Get a compact car full of discount tags
    If you're feeling trapped or too attached
    Remember we wanted that

    And if you need money for bills this month, my love, I'd cover you
    And if you have to lie to everyone, well I'd cover up for you

    Cause we're growing older, growing up
    Just like our parents before us
    With your new job at the coffee shop
    We're ready for anything

    And we'll graduate the middle class
    Get a nicer car full of shopping bags
    If you're feeling sad, kind of detached
    Remember we wanted that
    Remember we wanted that

    Cause I sold some shit, I'm saving up
    We can get that house next to the park
    With the extra hours I picked up
    We will pay for everything
